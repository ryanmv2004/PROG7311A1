In order to be able to run this application open up in visual studio and click shift + f6 or click on the green run button on the tool bar.
In order for safety there is only one 'admin' account due to security reasons. As I do not believe that there should be a way for someone on the site to create admin/employee accounts.
The Login details for this admin account is as follows:
Email: test@agriconnect.com
Password: test
